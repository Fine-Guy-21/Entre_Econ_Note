Basics of Economics     
    # Definition of economics
        "There is no universally accepted definition of economics, because different economists defined economics 
         from different perspectives."
         "Economics is a social science which studies about efficient allocation of scarce resources so as to attain 
          the maximum fulfillment of unlimited human needs."
         "economics is a science of choice, it studies how people choose to use scarce or limited productive resources
          to produce something"
        Key points
         * Study about scarce resources
         * Study about allocation of resources;
         * Allocation should be efficient;
         * Human needs are unlimited
         * Study how to satisfy the unlimited human needs 

    # The rationales of economics
        The two fundamental facts 
            * Human ("society's") material wants are unlimited
            * Economic resources are limited ("scarce").
        - Study How we make choices to use the scarce resources ( Decision Making)
        - Study How various choice s outcome based on Efficiency , Equity , Stability  
    # Scope and method of analysis in economics
        # Scope of economics
            the core of modern economics is formed by its two major branches:             

        "Microeconomics" 
             concerned with the economic behavior of individual decision making
             Studies "individual" economic units of an economy.
             Its central problem is "price determination" and "allocation of resources".
             Its main tools are the demand and supply of "particular" commodities and factors
             Concerned with how the "equilibrium" of "a consumer", "a producer" or "an industry" is attained

        "Macroeconomics" 
             deals with the effects and consequences of the aggregate behaviour of all decision making 
             Studies an economy as a "whole" and its "aggregates"
             Its central problem is determination of "level of income" and "employment".
             Its main tools are "aggregate" demand and "aggregate" supply of an economy as a "whole"
             Concerned with the determination of "equilibrium" "levels of income" and "employment" at "aggregate level".
    
    #  Positive and normative analysis
        The two perspectives of economics are :

            "Positive Economics" 
                Concerned with analysis of facts and attempts describe the world as it is 
                It does not judge a system as good or bad, better or worse
            "Normative Economics"
                Evaluates the desirability of alternative outcomes based on ones value judgments about what is good or what is bad 
                It is loaded with judgments 
                It is a matter of opinion Since What is good for one may not be the same for others
                Any disagreement can be solved by voting  

    # Inductive & Deductive Reasoning in economics 
        The two methods of logical reasoning :
            
            "Inductive reasoning" 
                A logical method of "reaching" at a "correct general statement" from several "independent" and "specific correct statements".
                Deriving theory by moving from "facts" to "theories" and from "particular" to "general" economic analysis. 
                It involves :
                    1. Selecting problem for analysis
                    2. Collection, classification, and analysis of data
                    3. Establishing cause and effect relationship between economic phenomena.
            "Deductive reasoning"
                A logical way of arriving at a particular or specific correct statement starting from a correct general statement.
                It involves :
                    1. Problem identification
                    2. Specification of the assumptions
                    3. Formulating hypotheses
                    4. Testing the validity of the hypotheses
        # Scarcity, choice, opportunity cost and production possibilities frontier
            The central purpose of economic activity :
                - Production of goods and services to satisfy consumers needs and wants
                - To meet peoples need for consumption both means of Survival & satisfy ever growing demand for improvised lifestyle

            1."Scarcity" :
                refers to all economic resources that are required to produce goods & services are finite or limited  
                it reflect the imbalance of wants & the means to satisfy the wants 
            
                "Resources" 
                    "Free resources" - available amount > the amount needed 
                    "Scarce (economic) resources" - available amount < the amount needed  
                        Land - natural resources & usable for the production of goods & service. # Reward : Rent
                        Labour - efforts of human being for the production of goods & service. # Reward : Wage
                        Capital - manufactured inputs for the production of goods & service # Reward : Interest
                        Entrepreneurship - special type of human talent that help us organize the production of goods & service # Reward : Profit

                "Shortage" is a specific and short term problem but "Scarcity" is a universal and everlasting problem
            2."Choice" :
                Since economic resources are scarce , we can not satisfy all our wants. Therefore "Choices must be made".
                we are forced to make a choice on what to produce, in what quantity & what not to produce 
                Scarcity implies Choice , & Choice implies Cost  
                
            3."Opportunity Cost" :
                A decision to have more of one thing, at the same time, means a decision to have less of another thing , so 
                "opportunity cost" is the amount or value of the next best alternative that must be sacrificed (forgone) in order to obtain 
                one more unit of a product. 
            4."The Production Possibilities Frontier or Curve (PPF/ PPC)" :
                "(PPF/PPC)" -a curve that shows various possible combinations of goods and services that we can produce
                    (PPF/PPC) describe 3 important concepts
                        1. concept of scarcity 
                        2. concept of choice 
                        3. concept of opportunity cost

                    Opportunity_cost = |Change in sacrificed good / Change in the gained good|

            5."Economic Growth and the PPF" 
                - Economic growth is represented by outward shift of the PPF 
                - A shift of the PPF along the Y- axis or X-axis is called "asymmetric growth"  


            Scarcity → limited resource → limited output → unable to satisfy all our wants → choice involves costs → opportunity cost

    # Basic economic questions / Central economic problems
        "What to produce"?
            problem of allocation of resources
            decide which good to produce & in what quantities   
        "How to produce"?
            problem of choice of technique
                labour-intensive techniques 
                    the use of more labour relative to capital, per unit of output
                capital-intensive techniques
                    the use of more capital relative to labour, per unit of output
        "For whom to produce"?
            problem of distribution of national product
            relates to how a material product is to be distributed among the members of a society    

    # Economic systems
        is a set of organizational and institutional arrangements established to answer the basic economic questions
        
        # Capitalist economy
            * the oldest economic system 
            * all production are privately owned , takes place by individual private Entrepreneurs who works for private Profit
            - government intervention is minimal
            Features of Capitalist Economy
                - "The right to private property"

            Advantage of Capitalist economy
                - "Flexibility or adaptability"
                - "Decentralization of economic power"
                - "New types of consumer goods"
                - "Growth of entrepreneurship"
                - "Optimum utilization of productive resource"
            Disadvantages of Capitalist economy
                - "Inequality of income"
                - "Unbalanced economic activity"
                - "Exploitation of Labor"
                - "Negative externalities"

        # Command economy
            - socialistic economy 
            - The economic institutions that are engaged in production and distribution are owned and controlled by the state
            Features of Command Economy
                - "Collective ownership"
                - "Central economic planning"

                - "Relative equality of incomes"
            Advantage of Command economy
                - "Absence of wasteful competition"
                - "Balanced economic growth"
                - "Elimination of private monopolies and inequalities"
            Disadvantages of Command economy
                - "Absence of automatic price determination"
                - "Absence of incentives for hard work and efficiency"
                - "Lack of economic freedom"
                - "Red-tapism"

        # Mixed economy
            is an attempt to combine the advantages of both the capitalistic economy and the command economy
            Features of Mixed Economy
                - "Co-existence of public and private sectors"
                - "Economic welfare"
                - "Economic planning"
                - "price mechanism"
                - "Economic equality"
            Advantages of Mixed Economy
                - "Private property, price mechanism, profit motive"
                - "Adequate freedom"
                - "Rapid and planned economic development"
                - "Social welfare & fewer economic inequalities"
            Disadvantages of Mixed Economy
                - "Ineffectiveness and inefficiency"
                - "Economic fluctuations"
                - "Corruption and black market"

    # Decision making units and the circular flow model
        * The three decision making units in a closed economy or Economic agents
          closed economic : if a country does not have economic interaction with other countries
            1.(Household)
                "A household can be one person or more who live under one roof and make joint financial decisions"
                    a= Selling of their resources, and
                    b= Buying of goods and services
            2.(Firm)
                "A firm is a business organization that uses economic resources to produce goods and services"
                    a= Buying of economic resources
                    b= Selling of their products.
            3.(Government)
                "A government is an organization that has legal and political power to control or influence households, firms and markets.
                They also provides some types of goods and services known as public goods and services for the society."

        * These 3 agents interact in two markets
            - Product Market
                * It is a market where goods and services are transacted/ exchanged
                * Households and governments buy goods and services from business firms.
            - Formal Market (input Market)
                * owners of resources (households) sell their resources to business firms and governments.
        
                * The (circular flow-diagram) is a visual model of the economy that shows how money (Birr), economic resources and 
                  goods and services flows through markets among the decision making units.
